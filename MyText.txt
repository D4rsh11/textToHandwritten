^^Welcome#
This code is a clever and dynamic system for generating stylized#
text images using custom character graphics. #
It simulates typesetting by placing individual letter images on a#
page, complete with support for special formatting, tables, and#
pagination. What makes it especially awesome is its graceful error#
handlingâ€”it skips missing assets without breaking the flow,#
ensuring smooth, uninterrupted execution. The modular design and#
random spacing add a human-like touch, making it ideal for creative#
text rendering or anti-automation tasks like CAPTCHA generation.#
